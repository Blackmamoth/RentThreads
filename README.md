## Inspiration
StyleLease is a ecommerce renting website the idea behind developing this application was about the growing trend of subscription-based models and the need for sustainable consumption in the retail industry.
 
## What it does
Stylelease webstte allows customers to rent or borrow items for a certain period of time, rather than purchasing them outright. This can be particularly beneficial for items that are only needed for a short period, such as formal wear or outdoor gear.Additionally, it can also help businesses to increase customer loyalty and reduce waste associated with overproduction.

## How we built it
We build the Website using the MERN stack

Mongodb
Express
React
Node

## Challenges we ran into
The challenges we ran into were Authentication and Authorization since it was our first project where we decided to have an Authorization process atlas we were not able to accomplish it rather we started working on making it more user-friendly in the due span of time also there is a delay in request to get received since we are using a free server(2-3 sec).

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
How the final website turned out, we like how the site is as functional as we originally expected it to be. We are proud that we had fun in the process and we met each other and we will work together outside of this hackathon!
